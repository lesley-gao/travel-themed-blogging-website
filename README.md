## About

This is a group project where we created a personal blogging system called "Blog Your Journey". This pilot website caters to travel enthusiasts, offering a platform to browse articles of interest and write their own to share personal journeys with the world.

<br />

## Main Features

- Visitors can easily browse all articles or search and sort articles.
- Users can create their accounts and build up their own blogging pages, showcasing their personal information and the articles they created. 
- Articles can be created using a user-friendly editor that allows for text formatting.  
- Other registered users can engage with articles by liking them and leaving comments. 
- Users can also choose to show or hide comments for a better reading experience.
- A responsive UI design that adapts to different screen sizes
